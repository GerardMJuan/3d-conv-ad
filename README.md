# 3d-conv-ad
Implementation and testing of 3D convolutional neural networks for AD diagnosis. This code can serve as a stepping point, as it is not finished. Need to keep working on it!

## How to run on HPC UPF
Just run the run_hpc.sh script. It is already prepared to work.

## What is left to do
* Do the preprocessing before training. In short, complete the preprocessing.py script. Also, data augmentation.
* Improve the model. Deeper, more complex than binary, etc.
* Visualization and interpretation.

Model is based on "Basu S, Wagstyl K, Zandifar A, Collins L, Romero A, Precup D.
